## How to create a good Bug Report?

If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed quickly. So fixing a bug depends on how effectively it's reported.

### 1) Reproducible:

If your bug is not reproducible it will be hard to fix it. You should clearly try to **provide the steps to reproduce the bug**.
Do not assume or skip any reproducing step. A step-by-step description of the issue is easy to reproduce and therefore fix.

### 2) Specific:

Do not write an essay about the bug. **Be specific and to the point**. Try to summarize it in minimum words yet in effective way.
Do not combine multiple bugs even if they seem to be similar.
Write different reports for each bug.

### 3) Environment Details:

If your bug seems to be related to your setup, **include some informations about it**.

### 4) Duplicate:

Before opening any report, you should do a quick research to **see if your bug isn't already reported** using the [labels](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/labels).
If you have additionnal informations about it, please comment the already opened issue.
